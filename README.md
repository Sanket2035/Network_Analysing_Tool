1. Packet Capture
Objective: To monitor and capture network traffic data packets from a specified network interface.
Tools and Libraries: pyshark
Steps:
	i.	Set Up Interface: Specify the network interface (e.g., 'Wi-Fi') from which packets will be captured.
	ii.	Capture Packets: Use the pyshark.LiveCapture function to initiate real-time packet capture.
	iii.	Sniff Packets: Call the sniff method to capture a predefined number of packets (e.g., 100 packets).
	iv.	Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage exceptions that may occur during the packet capture process.

 
2. Data Storage and Conversion
Objective: To store captured packets and convert them into a format suitable for analysis.
Tools and Libraries: pandas
Steps:
	i.	Create Storage Class: Implement a PacketStorage class to manage captured packets.
	ii.	Add Packets to Storage: Use the add_packet method to add each captured packet to the storage.
	iii.	Convert to DataFrame: Implement a to_dataframe method to convert the stored packets into a pandas DataFrame, including columns for source IP, destination IP, protocol, and timestamp.

 
3. Data Visualization
Objective: To create visual representations of network traffic data for better understanding and analysis.
Tools and Libraries: matplotlib, seaborn
Steps:
	i.	Traffic Volume Plot:
		a.	Convert the timestamp column to datetime format.
		b.	Resample the data by minute to calculate traffic volume.
		c.	Plot the traffic volume over time.
	ii.	Protocol Distribution Plot:
		a.	Use a count plot to visualize the distribution of different network protocols.

 
4. Anomaly Detection
Objective: To detect anomalies in the network traffic data using machine learning.
Tools and Libraries: sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest
Steps:
	i.	Feature Engineering:
		a.	Hash the source IP, destination IP, and protocol to create numerical features.
	ii.	Model Training:
		a.	Initialize and train the Isolation Forest model with a specified contamination factor.
	iii.	Anomaly Detection:
		a.	Use the trained model to predict anomalies in the data.

 
5. Alert System
Objective: To notify administrators of detected anomalies via email.
Tools and Libraries: smtplib, email.mime
Steps:
	i.	Email Setup:
		a.	Configure the SMTP server details.
		b.	Create the email content, including the list of detected anomalies.
	ii.	Send Email:
		a.	Log in to the SMTP server and send the email to the specified recipient.
	
 
6. Continuous Monitoring
Objective: To ensure the system runs continuously, capturing data and detecting anomalies in real-time.
Steps:
	i.	Main Function Loop:
		a.	Create a main function to encapsulate the entire process.
		b.	Run the main function in an infinite loop with appropriate sleep intervals to ensure continuous monitoring.
		
By following this detailed methodology, the project systematically captures, analyses, visualizes, and detects anomalies
in network traffic, providing a comprehensive approach to enhancing network security.
